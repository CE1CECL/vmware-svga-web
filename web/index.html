    <p>
    The <i>VMware SVGA II</i> device is the virtual graphics card
    implemented by all VMware virtualization products. If you're running
    a virtual machine using VMware Workstation, Fusion, Player, or ESX,
    this is the graphics card that your virtual machine sees.
    </p>

    <p>
    This graphics card doesn't look quite like any physical graphics
    card that exists. In many ways it resembles a physical device,
    but in other ways its programming model has been idealized or
    otherwise modified to make it easier to emulate.
    </p>

    <p>
    VMware's desktop virtualization products (Fusion, Workstation,
    Player) can use your machine's physical graphics hardware to
    implement acceleration for the VMware SVGA device. Currently it
    supports a small amount of 2D acceleration, cursor acceleration,
    video overlay support, and 3D graphics with Shader Model 2.0. All
    of this acceleration is provided via a virtualized graphics
    interface, so the same drivers in the VM work regardless of what
    physical graphics card, if any, is physically available.
    </p>

    <p>
    This project is a package of developer-oriented documentation for
    the details of this virtualized graphics interface.  It consists
    of some basic documentation, as well as a package of example
    programs which demonstrate how to draw 2D and 3D graphics inside
    a virtual machine. These examples run on the (virtual) bare metal,
    without any OS or any other graphics driver loaded.
    </p>

    <p>
    This package is provided for educational purposes, and for people
    who are developing 3D drivers. It may be especially interesting to
    hobbyist OS authors, or developers who want to experiment with
    low-level 3D graphics without the complexity of a physical GPU's
    programming interface.
    </p>

    <p>
    This code won't help you if you're writing normal user-level apps
    that you'd like to run inside a virtual machine. It's for driver
    authors, and it assumes a reasonable amount of prior knowledge
    about graphics hardware.
    </p>

    <h2 class="first">Requirements</h2>

    <p>
    Binaries are included if you just want to try out the examples.
    To compile the code yourself, you'll need a few basic open source tools:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A recent version of GCC and binutils. <br /> I use GCC 4.2 (Older versions may
    require tweaking the Makefile.rules file slightly.)</li>
      <li>GNU Make</li>
      <li>Python</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To run the examples, you'll need a recent version of VMware
     Workstation, Fusion, or the free VMware Player. Some of the examples
     will work on older versions, but Workstation 6.5.x or Fusion 2.0.x is
     strongly recommended.</p>
